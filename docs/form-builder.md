## Business Rules / User Journey

As a User, I can:

- Use a Drag 'n Drop interface to create simple forms using input fields for text, radio, dropdown and checkboxes
- Edit options and titles of each for question
- See the JSON generated for the forms I build, which can be used for creating forms with Survey JS
- See example forms, including regular surveys, quizzes and scored surveys

## Store

A simple store manages the creation of forms in the form builder
