# Reusable Backend

This is a Node JS template application using DDD and TDD with a log in functionality made from scratch with Fastify JS, Prisma JS and PostgreSQL. The page hosted in this project just contains basic information about what the actual project does. Follow the GitHub Link inside of it to see the live project. This project has been converted from a different type of project, so some components may contain legacy elements.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: Next JS, React JS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadcnUI, Zustand, Jest, Cypress
Backend: JavaScript, Node JS, Typescript, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Vitest, Supertest, Prisma, Docker, Zod

## Components

This work for this project is heavier in the backend repositories. The frontend displayed here is a simple introduction to the project and a link to it.

## Services

A simple fetching function which gets project data from Supabase is available here. This is no longer required for the current version of the project

## Backend Implementation

Please refer to the specific backend project to see more about how it works.

## Tests

This feature uses :

1. A simple Jest unit test to check if only the correct elements render;
2. A simple Cypress E2E test to check if a user can visit the page and visualise elements the correct way
