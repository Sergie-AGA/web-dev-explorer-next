# useKeyPress Hook

The `useKeyPress` hook allows you to handle specific key combinations in a React component by passing in an array of key combinations and their associated callback functions.

### Descriptions

- **`keyCombos`** (`KeyCombo[]`): An array of key combinations. Each `KeyCombo` consists of:
  - **`keys`** (`KeyType[]`): An array of keys in the combination. This can include specific keys like `"Shift"`, `"Control"`, `"Alt"`, `"Meta"`, or other string values for regular keys.
  - **`callback`** (`CallbackType`): A function to be executed when the specified key combination is pressed. This function receives the keyboard event as an argument.

### Example Scenarios

- **If you want to execute a callback on a single key press (e.g., "Enter")**:

  ```js
  useKeyPress([
    {
      keys: ["Enter"],
      callback: (event) => {
        console.log("Enter key pressed");
      },
    },
  ]);
  ```

- **If you want to handle a combination of keys (e.g., "Control" + "S")**:

  ```js
  useKeyPress([
    {
      keys: ["Control", "S"],
      callback: (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log("Control + S pressed");
      },
    },
  ]);
  ```

- **If you want to execute different callbacks for multiple combinations**:

  ```js
  useKeyPress([
    {
      keys: ["Alt", "A"],
      callback: (event) => {
        console.log("Alt + A pressed");
      },
    },
    {
      keys: ["Shift", "Enter"],
      callback: (event) => {
        console.log("Shift + Enter pressed");
      },
    },
  ]);
  ```

This hook provides flexibility in handling complex keyboard shortcuts by allowing custom key combinations and associated actions within a React component.
