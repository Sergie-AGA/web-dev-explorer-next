# Calculate Price Utility

The `calculatePrice` function computes two types of prices for a product: `discountedPrice` and `pickUpPrice`. It uses a base discount system with adjustable levels and a pickup bonus discount when applicable.

## Parameters

- **`product`** (`IProduct`): An object representing a product. This object should contain:
  - `basePrice`: The base price of the product.
  - `discount`: Optional custom discount as a decimal (e.g., 0.3 for 30%).
  - `priceLevel`: The level of discount applied based on the number of items, with the following values:
    - `1` - 55% discount
    - `2` - 40% discount
    - `3` - 20% discount
  - `pickUpBonus`: A boolean indicating if an additional pickup discount should apply (20% discount).

## Usage Examples

- **If you want to calculate a standard discount without pickup**:

  ```js
  import { calculatePrice } from "@/utils/calculatePrice";

  const product = {
    basePrice: 100,
    priceLevel: 2, // 40% discount from discountMap
  };

  const { discountedPrice, pickUpPrice } = calculatePrice(product);
  console.log(discountedPrice); // Output: 60
  console.log(pickUpPrice); // Output: 60 (no pickup bonus)
  ```

- **If you want to calculate a discount with a custom discount rate**:

  ```js
  const product = {
    basePrice: 200,
    discount: 0.25, // Custom 25% discount
  };

  const { discountedPrice, pickUpPrice } = calculatePrice(product);
  console.log(discountedPrice); // Output: 150
  console.log(pickUpPrice); // Output: 150 (no pickup bonus)
  ```

- **If you want to include a pickup bonus in the price**:

  ```js
  const product = {
    basePrice: 150,
    priceLevel: 1, // 55% discount
    pickUpBonus: true, // Additional 20% pickup discount
  };

  const { discountedPrice, pickUpPrice } = calculatePrice(product);
  console.log(discountedPrice); // Output: 67.5 (basePrice - 55%)
  console.log(pickUpPrice); // Output: 37.5 (additional pickup discount)
  ```

This utility function provides flexibility in handling discounts by combining `discountMap` levels and custom discounts, enabling you to dynamically calculate prices based on various criteria.
