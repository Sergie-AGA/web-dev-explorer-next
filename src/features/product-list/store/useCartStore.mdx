# Cart Store

The `useCartStore` is a Zustand store that manages the cart state within the application. This includes handling products, managing cart operations, calculating totals, and syncing the cart state with local storage.

### Usage

If you want to import and use all elements of the store:

```js
import { useCartStore } from "@/store/useCartStore";

const {
  total,
  cart,
  products,
  setProducts,
  addToCart,
  removeFromCart,
  swapOption,
  calculateTotals,
  setLocalStorage,
  getLocalStorage,
} = useCartStore((state) => ({
  total: state.total,
  cart: state.cart,
  products: state.products,
  setProducts: state.setProducts,
  addToCart: state.addToCart,
  removeFromCart: state.removeFromCart,
  swapOption: state.swapOption,
  calculateTotals: state.calculateTotals,
  setLocalStorage: state.setLocalStorage,
  getLocalStorage: state.getLocalStorage,
}));
```

### Descriptions

- **`total`** (`ITotal`): An object representing the overall totals for the cart.
  - **`total`**: The total price of items in the cart after discounts.
  - **`totalSavings`**: Total savings calculated across items.
  - **`totalSavingsPercentage`**: The percentage of savings relative to the base price.
- **`cart`** (`ICart[]`): An array of items currently in the cart, each item including details like the product, chosen option, final price, savings, and bundle status.

- **`products`** (`IProduct[]`): An array of all available products.

- **`setProducts`** (`(products: IProduct[]) => void`): Sets the list of products.

- **`addToCart`** (`(ProductData: ICart) => void`): Adds an item to the cart and recalculates totals. Syncs with local storage.

- **`removeFromCart`** (`(id: string) => void`): Removes an item from the cart by ID and updates totals.

- **`swapOption`** (`(id: string) => void`): Changes the option type for an item in the cart.

- **`calculateTotals`**: Recalculates total cost, savings, and percentage savings for items in the cart.

- **`setLocalStorage`**: Stores the current cart state in local storage.

- **`getLocalStorage`**: Loads the cart from local storage if available.

### Example Scenarios

- **If you want to add a product to the cart**:

  ```js
  addToCart({
    product: selectedProduct,
    option: "discount",
    finalPrice: 100,
    savings: 20,
    percentageSavings: "20%",
  });
  ```

- **If you want to remove an item from the cart**:

  ```js
  removeFromCart(selectedProductId);
  ```

- **If you want to toggle the option type for a cart item**:

  ```js
  swapOption(selectedProductId); // Changes the option for the specified product
  ```

- **If you want to load and save cart state to local storage**:

  ```js
  getLocalStorage(); // Load cart data from local storage if available
  setLocalStorage(); // Save the current cart state to local storage
  ```

This store manages complex cart operations, ensuring calculations and state persistence across sessions.
