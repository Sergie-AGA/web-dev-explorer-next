# UI Store

The `useUIStore` is a Zustand store that manages UI state across the application. This store handles the visibility and type of modals, as well as the currently active technology in focus.

### Usage

```js
import { useUIStore } from "@/store/useUIStore";

const { globalModal, toggleModal, openModal, activeTech, setActiveTech } =
  useUIStore((state) => ({
    globalModal: state.globalModal,
    toggleModal: state.toggleModal,
    openModal: state.openModal,
    activeTech: state.activeTech,
    setActiveTech: state.setActiveTech,
  }));
```

### Descriptions

- **`globalModal`** (`{ isOpen: boolean; type: modalType }`): Represents the state of the global modal. It includes:
  - **`isOpen`**: Boolean value indicating whether the modal is open.
  - **`type`**: Defines the type of modal, which can be `"tech"` or `"filter"`.
- **`toggleModal`** (`(type?: modalType) => void`): Toggles the visibility of the modal. If a `type` is provided, it sets the modal type accordingly.

- **`openModal`** (`(type?: modalType) => void`): Opens the modal directly and sets its type to the specified value (default is `"tech"`).

- **`activeTech`** (`{ type: ITechTypes; tech: string } | null`): Stores the currently active technology in focus. Includes:

  - **`type`**: The type of technology, specified by the `ITechTypes` enum.
  - **`tech`**: A string representing the technology name.

- **`setActiveTech`** (`(tech: string, type: ITechTypes) => void`): Sets the `activeTech` state with the specified technology name and type.

### Example Scenarios

- **If you want to toggle the global modal visibility**:

  ```js
  toggleModal("filter"); // Toggles the modal and sets type to "filter"
  ```

- **If you want to open the modal with a specific type**:

  ```js
  openModal("tech"); // Opens the modal and sets the type to "tech"
  ```

- **If you want to set the active technology**:

  ```js
  setActiveTech("React", "frontend"); // Sets the active tech to "React" with type "frontend"
  ```

This store provides a structured way to manage UI state globally, allowing you to easily toggle and open modals, as well as set and retrieve the current active technology.
