# Welcome to Web Dev Explorer Storybook

Welcome to the **Web Dev Explorer** Storybook documentation! This project serves as a playground for exploring and testing a wide variety of web development features. It is structured around several mini-projects, each focused on different areas of development and providing reusable components, hooks, and utilities.

- [Visit the project](https://web-dev-explorer-next-kv4t.vercel.app/)

### Overview

The main purpose of **Web Dev Explorer** is to explore, test, and document different functionalities in web development, using a tech stack that includes:

- **Frontend**: React JS, Next JS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadcnUI, with automated testing using Jest and Cypress.
- **Backend & Infrastructure**: Supabase and Vercel, with additional projects in Node JS, Fastify, PostgreSQL, and other technologies.

This Storybook documentation provides a central place to view and interact with the components, hooks, and utilities used across various projects.

### Featured Projects

- **Product List POC**: A product listing proof-of-concept that uses Supabase for backend support, showcasing modern React and Next.js techniques for managing cart items, applying discounts, and managing state.
- **World of CSS Effects**: A collection of CSS techniques and animations that you can reuse for unique visual effects, including glitch effects, neon text, and more.
- **Reusable Backend**: A reusable Node JS application template using modern backend solutions to create scalable and reusable modules with DDD
- **Storybook Explorer**: This Storybook itself, configured with multiple addons and options to demonstrate its capabilities for creating organized, interactive UI documentation.

### Additional Repositories

Supporting repositories enhance this project, such as:

- [Web Dev Explorer Node JS](https://github.com/Sergie-AGA/web-dev-explorer-nodejs): Focuses on backend functionalities with Node.js, TypeScript, and Fastify, among others.

### Folder Structure

The application uses a scalable folder structure inspired by **Bulletproof React** and **Web Dev Simplified** patterns, ensuring each feature has its own encapsulated scope. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **App**: Uses Next.js App Router, organized with route groups like `(home)` and `(projects)` for logical separation.
- **Features**: Each project’s components, hooks, and services are scoped to their respective feature folder.
- **Hooks**: Global hooks, such as `useKeyPress` for handling key events and `useURLState` for managing URL-based state.
- **Services, Lib, Store**: Organized directories for setting up global services (like Supabase and Firebase), external libraries, and Zustand stores.

### Accessibility and Testing

Accessibility best practices are applied through semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, contrast considerations, and responsive design. The project emphasizes quality testing with Jest for unit testing and Cypress for E2E tests.

### Usage Guide

Here’s how you can get started and explore:

- **Explore Components**: Dive into reusable components for UI elements, interactive components, and more.
- **Review Hooks and Utilities**: Find useful hooks like `useKeyPress` for handling keyboard shortcuts and utilities for URL state management.
- **View Documentation**: Each project contains detailed documentation in Storybook, allowing you to understand each component and feature in depth.
