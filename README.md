# Web Dev Explorer

This is a project that aims to explore, test and aggregate a variety of Web Dev functionalities within different projects.
In general, the project uses:
Frontend: React JS, Next JS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and various automated testing tools
Backend & Infra: Supabase, Vercel
Documentation: and documented with Storybook JS and Markdown files
Libraries which have small impact may not be listed here or in the project data listing

## Additional Repositories

There are other repositories might work as support for this one, containing a different set of features:

- [Web Dev Explorer Node JS](https://github.com/Sergie-AGA/web-dev-explorer-nodejs) - Handles additional backend features, such as: Node JS, Typescript, Fastify, PostgreSQL, among many others. This is currently not powering live applications

## Running the project

This is mainly a Next JS project. Node 18.17+ is recommended for smooth functionality.
All you should need to run this is installing the modules and running the dev script list on the package.json. Projects which use Supabase will error, as the env variables have not been committed.

## Disclaimers

- This project is under the MIT License. Any suggestions are welcome, but since this is a project I use for learning purposes I will not accept external PRs into the code. However, feel free to grab code snippets if you want and use them in any way you want without need for attribution (though crediting me where it may be applicable is always appreciated)
- A lot of features here will be made during my first attempt at exploring a specific technology. Unless it is within the scope of the project to implement best practices, I will usually not return to a feature to improve the code quality, meaning some concepts will not necessarily be using the best standards in the market for a feature. Therefore, these features are only an insight into some of the technologies I have experimented with and do not necessarily reflect my approach to using them

## Project Overview

### Project 1 - Product List POC

This project experiments a proof of concept of a store, making use of Supabase to handle the backend and modern React ecosystem to render a Product List where you can add items to a cart and trigger discounts based on specific conditions. This was used by me to sell some of my personal belongings in the past.
Frontend: Next JS, React JS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Zustand, yet-another-react-lightbox, react-photo-album, Jest, Cypress
Backend: Supabase

### Project 2 - World of CSS Effects

A place where diverse CSS tricks and techniques are used to achieve unique visual effects. This is a place where you can find reusable CSS snippets ready to be copied and used in a different project, including examples of usage.
Frontend: Next JS, React JS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Zustand, Jest, Cypress

### Project 3 - Reusable Backend

This is a Node JS template application using DDD and TDD with a log in functionality made from scratch with Fastify JS, Prisma JS and PostgreSQL. The page hosted in this project just contains basic information about what the actual project does. Follow the GitHub Link inside of it to see the live project. This project has been converted from a different type of project, so some components may contain legacy elements
Frontend: Next JS, React JS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Zustand, Jest, Cypress
Backend: JavaScript, Node JS, Typescript, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Vitest, Supertest, Prisma, Docker, Zod

### Project 4 - Storybook Explorer

This project displays the Storybook JS implementation used in this project and explores its capabilities with addons and different options to create an organised UI documentation for the most important and reusable components in this project.
Frontend: Storybook JS, TypeScript, React JS
Others: GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions

### Project 5 - Form Builder

This project explores the functionalities of Survey JS to create a range of dynamic surveys. It consists of 2 parts: 1) A form Builder to build custom surveys with simple properties, forms and quizzes; 2) Example Forms using slightly more complex data.
Frontend: Next JS, React JS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Survey JS

## Abandoned Projects

Abandoned projects are kept in the code if they reached some decent level of progress before being abandoned so that the code is still available to be used and maybe for a future completion of the project.

The following projects have been abandoned after some progress:

- State Mock Endpoint: A place where you can store what an endpoint is currently returning at a given point in time using Firebase
- Gotta Catch 'Em All: A game using the Pok√©API to battle and capture against Pok√©mon
